# Selection of a region for oil development

**Problem:**
The oil company wants to find the most suitable region for the development of new wells, which is likely to bring the greatest income.

We have data from oil samples in three regions:  10,000 wells in each with measured the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves.

**What was done:**

Data preprocessing was made.
Oil supply for break-even development was calculated.

Models were constructed to predict the oil supply in each well.

We calculated profit of oil development in each region taking into account product reserve, budget per region and product profit.
